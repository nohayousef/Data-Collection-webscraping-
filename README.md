Web Scraping Assignment
📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates basic web scraping techniques using Python. It was developed as part of a data analysis or web scraping learning module. The primary goal is to extract structured data from a web page using libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas, and then save it into a CSV file for further analysis or reporting.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python: Programming language

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive development environment

requests: To send HTTP requests and fetch web pages

BeautifulSoup: To parse and navigate HTML content

pandas: To clean and structure the extracted data into tabular format

csv: To export the data into a CSV file

📂 Project Structure
Web Scrapping Assignment (noha).ipynb – Main notebook containing the scraping logic, data extraction, cleaning, and export steps.

🔍 What It Does
Sends a request to a target website.

Parses HTML content to locate specific tags and extract meaningful data (such as product names, prices, etc.).

Cleans and organizes the data using pandas.

Exports the final dataset to a .csv file for further use.

▶️ How to Run
Clone or download this repository.

Install required libraries (if not already installed):

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook "Web Scrapping Assignment (noha).ipynb"
Run the cells sequentially to perform web scraping and export the results.

⚠️ Notes
Ensure you have a stable internet connection while running the notebook.

The scraping is done on publicly available web pages that allow scraping. Always check a website’s robots.txt before scraping.

📈 Possible Extensions
Add exception handling for network issues.

Schedule scraping using a task scheduler or cron.

Save data to a database instead of a CSV.

Visualize the scraped data using matplotlib or seaborn.
